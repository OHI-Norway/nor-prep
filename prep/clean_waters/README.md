# Clean waters goal: data and analysis

In this goal, we assess to what extent the coastal waters in northern Norway are unpolluted. Under pollution we understand any kind of pollution - with organic and inorganic compounds, pollution related to human acitvities on the coast, and marine debris.

There are two components in the Clean waters goal:

* Status of coastal water entities based on ecological and chemical parameters

* Marine debris  - accumulation of debris on the beaches in northern Norway (unfinished yet)

## Status of coastal water entities
This classification of water entities is based on the Water Framework directive, in a way it is implemented in Norway. Ecological status is measured as biota-related characteristics, chemical status - as the level of pollutants in the sediments, biota and water.
The assessemnts are done about every 6 years. The results are visualized on the map [here](https://vann-nett.no/portal/#/mainmap).

## Marine debris
There is no good data on marine debris for the coast of northern Norway. The project by [Salt](https://salt.nu/en/) has done an assessment of marine debris accumulation on selected beaches in northern Norway. We might use these data to create a marine debris index, but this index will be relevant only for some municipalities.
