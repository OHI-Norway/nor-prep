## Calculations of the fisheries goal

This folder contains the R codes (as Rmd) used to prepare catch data and ices data for the estimation of the fisheries goal.
*raw* folder contains raw data (data that can be publicly available), and *data* folder contains the csv-tables that we created for the estimation of fisheries goas as well as the table with final fisheries score (see README.md in the *data* folder).
