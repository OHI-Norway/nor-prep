# Importing formatted catches and stocks data

fish_nor <-catch %>% 
           left_join(stock_scores_prep, 
                  by = c("Year", "English"
                  ))

Checking the number of data points per species
```{r}

# Further data cleaning: removing and re-arranging locations 
Deleting municipalities that are not in the study (Beiarn county and Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino)
Re-estimating landings for the municipalities that were merged (Bodo + Skjerstad_2005, Bjarkoy_2013 + Harstad_2013) - I sum the landings for these pairs of municipalities for the years before they've merged. 
Using this approach to merge catches will create duplicated rows, I remove them in the chunk after.
```{r}
fish_nor_prep <- fish_nor %>% 
                  rename(Species = English) %>% 
                  mutate(Municip_name = as.character(Municip_name)) %>% 
                  filter(!Municip_name %in% c("Beiarn", "Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino")) %>% 
                  mutate(newid = case_when(Municip_name %in% c("Harstad_2013", "Bjarkoy_2013") ~ "1",
                                           Municip_name %in% c("Bodo", "Skjerstad_2005") ~ "2",
                                           TRUE ~ Municip_name)) %>% 
                  group_by(newid, Year, Species) %>%  
                  mutate(Total_catch_new = sum(Total_catch))
```


In this table, *Municip_name_new* are the names of the municipalities after they've merged. *Total_catch_new* is the total fish landings after municipalities merged.

```{r}
fish_nor_prep2 <- fish_nor_prep %>% 
                  ungroup() %>% 
                  select(-c("Municip_name", "Total_catch")) %>% 
                  mutate(Municip_name_new = newid) %>% 
                  mutate(Municip_name_new = replace(Municip_name_new, Municip_name_new == "1", "Harstad")) %>% 
                  mutate(Municip_number = replace(Municip_number, Municip_name_new == "Harstad", "1903")) %>% 
                  mutate(Municip_name_new = replace(Municip_name_new, Municip_name_new == "2", "Bodo")) %>% 
                  mutate(Municip_number = replace(Municip_number, Municip_name_new == "Bodo", "1804")) %>% 
                  distinct_all() %>% 
                  select(-c(newid,  species_name))
```



# Examining the distribution of observations of catches by species, regardless of municipality
This graph shows how the number of municipalities, where the catch was delivered, varied from 1994 to 2018

catch_dist <- ggplot(data = fish_nor_prep2) +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(y = Species, x = Year, fill = Species)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1994, 2018, 4)) +

# Estimating cacth per area and maximal weighted catch
(Check fisheries README. for details). This approach however, has a danger of positive  outliers dominating 
the maximal catch per area. Due to multiple reasons, catch will vary in every municipality for each stock from year to year. Thus, a maximal catch (biomass) per area can be just an outlier, a seldom seen very high catch. Therefore most of the biomass.area/max.biomass.area ratios are very low (75% are less than 0.6).
The largest catch per sea area was observed in Ã˜ksnes in 2018, for Atlantic cod.

We do not have MSY-reference points for shrimp, but we can assume it is sustainable.
https://www.hi.no/hi/temasider/arter/kyst-og-fjordreke 
Similarly, for Kingcrab, I will assume its catches sustainable.

I remove redfish, blue whiting and greenland halibut from the table.
17.02.2020 we decided not to include these three species into the Fisheries sub-goal.

Calculation catch weighted scores (proportional catch multiplied by the stock score).
```{r}
seaarea <- seaarea %>% 
          mutate(Komnum = as.character(Komnum))   

weighted_catch_score <- fish_nor_prep2 %>%
  filter(!Species %in%
    c(
      "Redfish",
      "Greenland halibut",
       "Blue whiting"
    )) %>%
  mutate(stock_score = replace(
    stock_score,
    Species == "Shrimp",
    1
  )) %>%
  mutate(stock_score = replace(
    stock_score,
    Species == "Kingcrab",
    1
  )) %>%
  left_join(seaarea[, c("Havflate", "Komnum")], by = c("Municip_number" = "Komnum")) %>%
  rename("Seaarea" = "Havflate") %>%
  mutate(catch_per_area = Total_catch_new / Seaarea) %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  mutate(max_catch_area = max(catch_per_area)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(weighted_catch =  catch_per_area / max_catch_area) %>%
  mutate(weighted_catch_score = weighted_catch * stock_score)
#Check the basic stats for weighted biomass score:
mosaic::fav_stats(weighted_catch_score$catch_per_area)

#write.csv(weighted_catch_score, "data/area_weighted_catch_and_catchscore.csv", row.names = F )

```


# Re-estimate weighted catch per area based on smoothed catches

## Apply 3-years rolling mean on catch data
Rolling mean is a remedy against inter-annual variability in catches and against influential outliers. 
I apply 3-year rolling mean to catch data. However,rolling mean does not help to smooth variability in catches between the municipalities.

When we apply a rolling mean, some observations will become NA (those at the edges of the 3-year window), because `rollapply` function calculates means of 3 overlapping years. Out of 8330 observations of catch, 1086 will become NA. The NAs are the first and the last year of a dataframe, made by unique combination of species and municipality. 
Since, there is certainly a temporal increase the total catches (taking a mean of all would be wrong), the best is to replace NA with the closest non-NA value, for instance for year 1994, take the catch of year 1995. I will do that with a `zoo::na.fill` function. 


A simple function, that takes a dataframe as an argument, checks the number of rows. It applies 3-years running mean only of dataframe has at least 6 rows of data, and does not change the values if there are less than 6 rows of data.
```{r}
runmean_on_df <- function(df, col){
  if (nrow(df) >= 6) {
    runmean <- rollapply(df[,col], width = 3, FUN = mean,  fill=list("extend"))
    df2 <-cbind(df, runmean)
  } else {
    runmean <-df[,col]
    df2 <-cbind(df, runmean)
  }
  df2
}
```


```{r}
municipalities <-unique(fish_nor_prep2$Municip_name_new)
species <-unique(fish_nor_prep2$Species)

splist <-list()
finallist <-list()
for (i in 1:length(municipalities)) 
  {
   mp <- municipalities[i]
   df.mp <- fish_nor_prep2 %>% 
      filter(Municip_name_new == mp)
    for (j in 1:length(species))
     {
        sp <- species[j]
        df.sp <- df.mp %>% 
            filter(Species == sp)
  
      #runmean <-data.frame(catch_runmean = rollapply(df.sp$Total_catch_new, width = 3, FUN = mean,  fill=NA))
      df.sp.runmean <- runmean_on_df(as.data.frame(df.sp), 14) #column 14 is Total_catch_new
      #df.sp.full <- bind_cols(df.sp, runmean)
      splist[[j]] <- df.sp.runmean
      smoothed_catches_spp <- do.call("rbind", splist)
      finallist[[i]] <-smoothed_catches_spp
    
    }
   
 }
 
smoothed_catches <- do.call("rbind", finallist) %>% 
  rename(catch_runmean = runmean)
colSums(is.na(smoothed_catches)) 
```



## Re-esitmate weighted catch per area based on smoothed catches
Since we remove three species, the resultant dataset is shorter - now with 6091 number of rows.
For the calculation of catch weighted score, I use maximal catch observed in a given year per species.
```{r}
smoothed_weighted_catch_score <- smoothed_catches %>%
  filter(!Species %in%
    c(
      "Redfish",
      "Greenland halibut",
      "Blue whiting"
    )) %>%
  mutate(stock_score = replace(
    stock_score,
    Species == "Shrimp",
    1
  )) %>%
  mutate(stock_score = replace(
    stock_score,
    Species == "Kingcrab",
    1
  )) %>% 
left_join(seaarea[, c("Havflate", "Komnum")], by = c("Municip_number" = "Komnum")) %>%
  rename("Seaarea" = "Havflate") %>%
  filter(!is.na(catch_runmean)) %>%
  mutate(catch_per_area = catch_runmean / Seaarea) %>%
  group_by(Year,Species) %>%
  mutate(max_catch_area = max(catch_per_area)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(weighted_catch = catch_per_area / max_catch_area) %>%
  mutate(weighted_catch_score = weighted_catch * stock_score)

#write.csv(smoothed_weighted_catch_score, "data/ smoothed_area_weighted_catch_and_catchscore.csv", row.names = F)

```

# Check the distribution of biomass/area for each stock
## Plot smoothed catches on a boxplot
