1) Get a table on rivers and their "innslag status", a digitalized table from page 37 of Aronsen et al 2019 report.
2) Import a table on northern Norwegian rivers with the coordinates of river start.
3) Import Akvakulturregisteret
4) Trun the Akva..registeret into an sf object, coordinates for the localities are provided.
5) Merge the table of rivers with the table of their status, turn this table into an sf object.
6) Calculate the 1D distance between each locality and each river (probably, you need to join the two tables firtst). 
7) Sort out only the distances that are less than 150 km
8) You should get a table like : locality -- river -- distance to river -- river status
for each locality (there will be multiple rows per locality)
